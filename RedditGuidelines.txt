Reddit Mod "Guidelines"

1. Be nice and friendly. Some users don't know in some cases what we are talking about. Yes, they might not be supposed to be 
reporting bugs in the first place, but also things like this need to be explained in a nice way (example: "The bug tracker is a
tool that is only supposed to be used by players with enough experience. This is not meant as an insult, but your issue is not 
complete to be on the tracker", example regarding someone messaging about "Incomplete" resolution). Keep in mind, we are somewhat
representing Mojang.

2. People can be angry, yes, people can be stupid, but that is no reason for us to behave the same way. If posts are against the 
rules, remove it. Explain them nice and friendly the current situation from your point of view. 

3. Don't hesitate to put a MEQS_WAI instead of straight WAI on a ticket if someone is posting a case on Reddit. The devs should 
look into that list more often anyway.

4. If two posts of the same issue have been posted, the newer one has to be deleted.

5. Discussions that are clearly not relating to anything on the bug tracker have to be removed.

6. Comments not following the rules or the rediquette have to be removed.

7. Any questions regarding this can be asked here or in the mojira IRC channel.
